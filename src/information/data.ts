export const DESCRIPTION =
  "ANTI (Automated Navigation and Trash Identification) represents the latest innovation in artificial intelligence aimed at creating a positive impact on the environment. Equipped with advanced AI technology like YOLO, ANTI efficiently finds visible trash and detects human presence. It's equipped with various sensors that allow ANTI to automatically collect trash. However, its main strength is how it interacts with people, encouraging them to dispose of nearby trash properly. This interaction helps increase their awareness and concern about litter in their surroundings";
